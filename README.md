## **Requirements of this week's projects:**

- [x] Your app queries at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method.
- [x] Your app features some dynamic content
A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.

- [x] A well-considered architecture for your app - think back to the workshops from the beginning of this week. Try to modularise your code, or break it down into separate files.
- [x] Document any key decisions about how you structure your code in your readme!
- [x] Code: break your JavaScript down into small functions with a clear input and output; this will make it easy to write tests
- [x] Tests: you must write tests!
- [x] Design: aim for a responsive, mobile-first design
- [x] Accessibility: same as always, we'll be running your code through accessibility checkers
- [x] Take appropriate measures when it comes to concealing private information (i.e. your API key!)
